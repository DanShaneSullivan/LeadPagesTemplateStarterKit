# Template Starter Kit

We thought creating a full-featured template would be a great way to document and share the various subtleties of a LeadPages template. As a bonus, we're making it available for all to use and learn from.

To use this template:

1. clone or download this repository to your local desktop;
2. modify the contents of the "leadpages-template" directory;
3. archive the "leadpages-template" directory using the .zip file format;
4. upload the resulting archive to LeadPages.
